# Chromium builds for Windows 7, 8, &amp; 8.1

Chromium ended support for Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and derivatives like Server 2008 R2, Home Server 2011, Server 2012, 2012 R2. \
The last official version for these platforms is `M109.0.5414.128` as per [Here](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/185534985/sunsetting-support-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-server-2012-and-2012-r2-in-early-2023).

I will also be attempting to backport patches and make builds of M110 that will work.
